# spot
[IAT359 Course Project]

Spot is Vancouver’s new all-in-one parking app. In a city full of congestion, tight curb spaces, and constant construction, parking becomes a daily frustration. Our app brings drivers everything they need into one place, from real-time spot availability to competitive price comparisons from different parking vendors. The app is designed to streamline the parking experience so that users can focus on where they need to go without the stress.
